const char *ARGS_DELIMITER = " " --> global variable : used as space delimiter when parsing the file name with the args 
                                     into an argv similar array structure where the program name is the first and args
                                     come in the following indices.                   
---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

    
  1. void init_argv(char **argv, char *file_name_) is the function responsible  for parsing
     it parses the file name with the args into an argv similar array structure where
     the program name is the first and args come in the following indices.
  2. Tokenize the file_name passed to process_execute function by spaces into 
     arguments using strtok_r in a loop where each token is placed in char**argv
     in ordder and the argv-ptr is advanced
  3. void append_to_argv(char **argv, bool *load_successful,struct semaphore *sema)
     function appends the boolean pointer for load successful and semaphore to the argv 2d array.
  4. Push tokenized strings into the stack from the reversed array structure **esp using
     void add_args_to_stack(void **esp_, char **argv)  function
  5. Push number of arguments into the stack (sz) then a dummy return value (0).
  
 * the code does not make any checks for memory overflowing. However,it is handled
   by making sure that the file_name passed is less than one page in memory by
   copying it into a new string of size one page.
   the code returns TID_ERROR in case of argv or fn_copy is NULL

    argv = palloc_get_page(0);
    fn_copy = palloc_get_page(0);
    if (argv == NULL || fn_copy == NULL)
    return TID_ERROR;
    strlcpy(fn_copy, file_name, PGSIZE);

 * Also by allocating enough memory for esp_ptrs[sz] which is equal to the argv size

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

   The strtok_r() function is a reentrant version strtok(). The saveptr argument is 
   a pointer to a char * variable that is used internally by strtok_r() in order to
   maintain context between successive calls that parse the same string.
 
   On the first call, both functions point to the string to be tokenized, NULL
   is passed to subsequent calls. Apparently, some state (i.e. pointer to next 
   token) needs to be saved between calls, strtok saves this state in a global 
   variable which causes problems because Pintos is a multi-threaded program
   and interleaved calls made by different threads will give unexpected results 
   due to race conditions occurring with the global state.

   strtok_r on the other hand, uses a pointer you pass to it in saving what it needs,
   which is unique for every thread, so results should be consistent.
   
  So in conclusion
 
   The strtok() function is not thread-safe.
   The strtok_r() function is thread-safe.

  -An open_file struct stores a file descriptor and a pointer to the open 
   file, the file name and a list_elem elem 
  -each thread has a list of such struct representing each file it has opened. 
  -File descriptors are unique within the entire OS to avoid confusion if a parent and 
   a child processes each open a file with a similar fd . If the parent passes the fd to
   a filesystem function to be read by its child . The child will open the its own file with 
   the same fd rather than the one passed by the parent

  1. wait system call only calls process-wait (pid) function
     which does the following:

    1. get child thread using the child thread iD
    2. if this is equal to NULL , return -1
    3. else it waits on the child's wait semaphore
    4. get the child exit status
    5.remove child from list
    6.return the exit status
  
 2. exit system call does the following
   
    1. acquire lock
    2. remove executable file by thread name
    3. release lock
    4. close files
    5. clear memory
    6. set the current thread exit status to the one passed as a function argument 
    7. if the current thread's parent has died , wait on the thread 's wait sema
    8. thread exits

- the system call handler calls the following function before executing any system call
  static void validate_addr(size_t *adr) 
  it validates the user address and get the corresponding page from page directory 
  otherwise it exits(-1)
  
- first the top of stack is addressed by 
   size_t *esp_ptr = f->esp;
   and it is validated by validate_addr()
   this is the first system call number
 then arguments are read from the stack using these pointers after that their addresses are being validated
    *(esp_ptr + 1)
    (size_t*)*(esp_ptr + 2)
    *(esp_ptr + 3)

- Before any obtained pointer is used, it is also validated, this is done 
  before anything else (i.e. before allocating any resources) to avoid any 
  resource leak.
  - Example: 
      - A program that puts address 0xC0000000 on the stack for example will be 
        killed by the kernel before it can do anything.
      - A program that tries to dereference 0xC0000000 will page_fault and will 
        also be killed by the kernel.

 -the exec system calls return (pid_t)process_execute(cmd_line);
 -In process_execute()
   we ensure that if loading the new executable fails, it returns -1
   so that it can't return before the new executable has completed by
     1) bool *load_successful = malloc(sizeof(bool)) --> the boolean specifies whether the loading was successful or not 
     2) struct semaphore *load_sema = malloc(sizeof(struct semaphore))--> the semaphore is used to wait on the loaded 
                                                                          process till finished or failed
     3) in case of failure the tid (obtained from thread_create in order to execute FILENAME ) is set to TID_ERROR and returned

  - We use thread_data to pass child process’s status (to its parent) and other information used to perform waiting process.
    A list of this struct resides inside parent for its children which will be freed when process is closed.
    struct list children_data_list;/* contains all children processes created using exec syscall (for user process thread) */

- These cases may happen:

1. P calls wait(C) before C exits:
    P will wait (by downing a semaphore) until it exits and the child upping the
    semaphore again. Then parent get exit status of the child and remove it from
    its list and free this resource.

2. P calls wait(C) after C exits:
    P will try to wait for its child by downing the semaphore which has already
    been upped by the child before exiting so it continues and get exit status 
    of the child and remove it from its list and free this resource.

3. P exits without waiting before C exits
    The children list inside P will be free. The child's struct will be freed as
    well and there will be no need to store exit status or upping any semaphores.

4. P exits after C exits
   the normal case : parent get exit status of the child and remove it from
   its list and free this resource.

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?
   
   -We chose the first method: to verify the validity of a user-provided pointer, then dereference it. 
    using the functions in "userprog/pagedir.c" and in "threads/vaddr.h"because it is the simplest way
    to handle user memory access and it is a straightforward approach.
