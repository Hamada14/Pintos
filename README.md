# pintos

Pintos is computer software, a simple instructional operating system framework for the x86 instruction set architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. It was created at Stanford University by Ben Pfaff in 2004.


Refer to user-prog branch for running phase 2 and thread-system branch for phase 1.
