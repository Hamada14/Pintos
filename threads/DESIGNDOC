devices/timer.c :  sleeping_threads --> static struct list for sleeping threads,sorted by wake_up time of each thread.
threads/thread.h :   int64_t wake_up_time --> time until wake up for a sleeping thread.
threads/thread.h :   struct list_elem sleeping_elem --> list element for when a thread is added to sleeping_threads list.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

   In a call to timer_sleep()

   1. Interrupts are disabled.
   2. The current threadâ€™s wake_up time is set to the given sleep ticks plus the current ticks.
   3. The thread is inserted to the sleeping threads list using a comparator to ensure sorted property of the list.
   4. the thread is blocked.
   5. Reset interrupt_level to its old_level value.

  effects of the timer interrupt handler: refer to devices/timer.c::timer_interrupt (struct intr_frame *args UNUSED)

   1. Interrupts are disabled.
   2. the ticks are incremented by 1.
	 3. call to thread_tick()
   4. loop on the sleeping threads list and for each thread with wake up time less than or equal the current ticks
        a- unblock thread
        b- remove it from its current list
				In case a thread has a higher wake_up_time, The loop is terminated. (List is sorted)
   5. Reset interrupt_level to its old_level value.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

   An ordered list sorted by the thread wake_up time is used, we iterate on the list
   and for each thread with wake up time less than or equal the current ticks
        a- unblock thread
        b- remove it from its current list
	 otherwise we terminate the loop, reducing the work done in the handler.
   By this means, we can minimize the time spent.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

  - the interrupts are disabled during each operation on list and reset to its old value at the end.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

   - the interrupts are disabled.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

  - This design based on having a sleeping threads list sorted by thread wake_up time
    following the design of ready list is reasonable and efficient in terms of
    minimization of the amount of time spent in the timer interrupt handler.
    This list was declared as a static global variable to be modified by several
    functions : insertion in time_sleep() or deletion in the timer interrupt handler.
    This design is safe too, interrupts are disabled during each operations at the beginning
    and enabled at the end

	- Different design considered: Instead of disabling interrupts we could have used synchronization primitives such as
		locks, but then timer_sleep could be interrupted and affected by the donation, Priority inversion, system.
		This design reduces the time when the interrupts are disabled but it would affect the robustness of the timer,
		because of the effect of priority donation.

		Our design is superior in term of achieving Idempotence where it'll have correct result.

threads/synch.h: 1) modifications in struct semaphore: addition of the following attributes
                 -int is_lock--> determines if the semaphore is a actually used by a lock or not.
                 -int priority --> specifies the holder thread priority based on donations.
                 -struct list_elem thread_key-->for each acquire() to know which thread is locked
                 -struct thread *holder--> the thread which owns the lock

								 2) NESTED_DONATION_MAX_DEPTH 8 : macro-define

threads/thread.h : 1) modifications in struct thread : addition of the following attributes
                  -int real_priority --> original priority of thread before donation
                  -struct semaphore *waiting_lock -->list of threads waiting for the lock
                  -struct list_elem sleeping_elem --> List element for sleeping threads list
                  -struct list_elem waiting_elem --> List element for waiting threads list


>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

- Each Lock has a pointer to the currently holding thread and the list of the waiting thread.
- Each thread has a pointer to the lock it's currently waiting for.

- In the following example it's shown how every lock points to the holding thread and can find the currently waiting threads.
- In this initial frame donation doesn't make a difference and the current running thread is Thread 8 whose priority is 43.

:: Thread - 8 (43, 43) :: <--------------- Current running thread
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

However if we add Thread-3 with a priority 45 to wait on Lock 1, then It'll increase the priority of the thread holding
Lock 1, (Increase Thread-4's priority from 30 to 45), which will increase the priority of the thread holding Lock-2(AKA Thread-7)
from priority 42 to 45.
Thus the current running thread will change from Thread - 8 to Thread - 7.

- In case a thread releases a lock then the priority of the new holder is equal to Max(threads in the waiting List).
- In short, the donation priority is recalculated but assuming the thread's priority is the initial priority not the one
achieved using donation except if it can get higher priority using any of the acquired locks.
That's why each thread holds a list describing the acquired locks.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

  - By iterating over the semaphore's waiters list to obtain the thread that have the maximum priority.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

  This function basically does the following
   1. calls sema_down(&lock-> semaphore) which does the following
     1.1 interrupts are disabled
     1.2 while the value of the semaphore equals zero
        1.2.1 push the thread to the waiters list
        1.2.2 if sema->is_lock and no mlfqs , execute priority donation method which does the following
             1.2.2.1 the nested priority maximum depth is set to 8 levels as required
             1.2.2.2 each time (from the 8) extracting the maximum-priority thread among the waiters
             1.2.2.3 give his priority to the lock
             1.2.2.4 check which thread has the lock and higher its priority accordingly
        1.2.3 block thread
     1.3 if sema->is_lock and no mlfqs,push in the acquired locks list and reset the waiting lock variable to null
     1.4 decrements the semaphore value and let the current thread be the the lock holder
     1.5 Set interrupts to the status before it was disabled
   2. set the lock holder to be the current thread


 *in the program, the nest priority depth is set to 8


>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

   - when a higher priority thread is waiting for the lock that means that the current thread has donated priority
     1. if this priority is because of the lock,  then it will be removed from its donors,lowering its priority
        and unblocking the higher priority thread.
     2. if it has priority because of another lock , nothing happens to the donors .
         the higher priority thread is kept blocked till the current thread loses its priority by releasing another lock

 this method does the following:
    1. set the holder lock to null
    2. calls sema_up()
      2.1 reset shoul_yield to false
      2.2 disable interrupts
      2.3 if this semaphore is_lock and no mlfqs
         2.3.1 remove from list
         2.3.2 reset priority
      2.4 if the list of lock witers is not empty
         2.4.1 get the maximum-priority element
         2.4.2 remove it from list
         2.4.3 change the value of the boolean should_yield by calling thread_unblock()
      2.5 increment the semaphore value by 1
      2.6 Set interrupts to the status before it was disabled
      2.7 if should_yield is true, calls thread_yields()

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

- Potential race condition is the case in which you try setting the priority to a certain value and a thread with higher
priority attempts to wake up, While yielding the current thread might not notice that higher priority thread.

- The current implementation avoids it by disabling the interrupts before setting the priority and resetting it back to
the initial value at the end of thread_set_priority().

- Yes, But It'll have to be added to the timer_interrupt_handler where both won't operate in the same time. the lock
will be acquired at the beginning of the interrupt and released at the end.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

- Maintaining a 'thread_key list' a 'holder'for each semaphore to know which thread holds the lock
  as well as -struct semaphore *waiting_lock -->list of threads waiting for the lock
             -struct list_elem sleeping_elem --> List element for sleeping threads list
             -struct list_elem waiting_elem --> List element for waiting threads list
  for each thread , make it easier to keep track of all the information about donations between threads
  While tracing this model, it gave a good and efficient performance.
  It is also good in terms of design and maintainability of the code, simple and easy to understand

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

   -It is unclear if two or more threads have equal priority,which thread is supposed to run.
    We assumed first thread enter the ready list is the one should run.
    BSD scheduler implementation is the same.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

  - Most of scheduling calculations occur inside the interrupt handler by calling
    threads/thread.c::thread_tick().This affect the performance  negatively specially
    when the number of threads increades.Every timer tick, thread_tick() (runs in an
    external interrupt context) is called and the recent_cpu and priority are recalculated
    for all threads, which is expensive.
    The only calculation outside the interrupt context is that of  the nice value
    of the running thread. The interrupt is disabled when it happens.

  - We implemented a macros to manipulate fixed-point numbers because macros are evaluated during compile time, thus
		they're faster during runtime because no function calls are attempted which seems more important to have for any
		operating systems, Supporting floating point arithmetic with low latency. because fixed point arithmetic can be
		used extensively over the scale of the system.
